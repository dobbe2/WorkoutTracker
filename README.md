# workout-tracker
This project uses MongoDB and Mongoose to log fitness data for a user.

## Functionality
This project allows the user to track different types of workouts for their fitness log. 

The logged data is composed of workouts which are broken down into individual exercises. 

At the default page, some statistics of the most recent workout are shown, and the user has the choice to continue adding data to a previous workout, create a new workout, or can click the Dashboard to get a visual summary of previous fitness activity. If the user selects one of the buttons to enter exercise data, they are asked to choose a new exercise type, and then based on the type will fill out some information about the individual exercise. Once filled the user chooses to add another exercise or to complete the workout.
